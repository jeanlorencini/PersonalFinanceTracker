Thank you for the recent updates. I've tested the new functionalities and have some important feedback, including a new feature request that would significantly improve the app's usability.

Here are the key points:

1. New Feature Request: Bulk Actions on the Transactions Page

To make managing a large number of transactions more efficient, it would be extremely helpful to perform actions in bulk.

Implementation Idea: Add a checkbox to each transaction row on the /transactions page, along with a "master" checkbox in the header to select all.
Required Actions: Once multiple transactions are selected, the user should be able to apply a bulk action, such as:
Bulk Delete: Delete all selected transactions at once (with a single confirmation).
Bulk Categorize: Apply a single category to all selected transactions. This would be a huge time-saver.
2. Bug Report: "Internal Server Error" on CSV Upload Persists

Unfortunately, the issue with the CSV import has returned. When I try to upload my bank statement, I am still redirected to the /upload_csv URL with an "Internal Server Error" message.

3. Crucial Improvement: Visual Feedback for the Import Process

This is directly related to the bug above. Currently, after attempting an upload, there is no visual feedback to confirm whether the process succeeded or failed. I only know there's an error because of the error page, but I don't know if any data was partially imported.

Request: After an upload attempt, the user should be redirected back to the Dashboard (or the Transactions page) and see a clear, temporary message (a "flash message") indicating the result:
On Success: A message like "Importação concluída! 150 transações foram adicionadas com sucesso." (Import complete! 150 transactions were successfully added.)
On Failure: A message like "Erro na importação. Verifique se o formato do arquivo está correto e tente novamente." (Import error. Please check if the file format is correct and try again.)
This visual feedback is critical for user confidence and to know immediately if there's a problem with the file or the system.

In summary, the key priorities are fixing the persistent import error, providing clear feedback for that process, and implementing bulk actions to make transaction management more efficient.
